Description:Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging is a noninvasive tool used to study brain function. Detecting activation is challenged by many factors, and even more so in low-signal scenarios that arise in the performance of high-level cognitive tasks. We provide a fully automated and fast adaptive smoothing and thresholding (FAST) algorithm that uses smoothing and extreme value theory on correlated statistical parametric maps for thresholding.
